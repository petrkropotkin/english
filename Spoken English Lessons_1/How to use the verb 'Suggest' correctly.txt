It's a common problem that with English learners:
a lot of people use the word  "suggest" incorrectly.
The thing to remember is that you suggest an idea,
not the person that you're making your suggestion to.
In other words, this is incorrect:

I suggest you to apply for a job there. ( wrong)

Instead, say one of these:
I suggest applying for a job there.
I suggest that you apply for a job there.

You may also hear sentences that are similar to the last one, but  without "that":
I suggest you apply for a job there.

In this sentence, it may seem like you're suggesting a person  instead of an idea.
But if you examine it more closely, you're  suggesting the complete idea that "you apply for a job there":

I suggest (you apply for a job there).
One other thing to remember: don't use "to" after suggest: I suggest to apply for a job there.

Here are some other examples which use "suggest" correctly:

I would suggest waiting a few more weeks.
He suggested I give you a call.
Didn't you suggest bringing in a consulting firm? //(bring in on) привлекать кого-л. к чему-л.
So do you suggest that we go forward with the surgery?

Now that you know how to use "suggest",
here's a bonus tip: the  word "recommend" works exactly the same way!
